**Atlacoin (ATLA):** *In a world divided by four elements — Memes, Stonks, FOMO and Diamond Hands — only one coin can bring balance to your crypto portfolio. Powered by the Scrypt PoS (Proof of Stake) algorithm, Atlacoin bends profits like Aang bends air. Just remember: with great power comes great volatility… and occasional moonshots.*

**Become an Avatarian to get free Atlacoins for staking and let your portfolio achieve inner balance.**
